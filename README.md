🚀 Just Launched: Voice-Powered Amazon Product Recommender 🛍️
I’m excited to share a project that combines voice recognition, natural language processing (NLP), and similarity search to create a smart product recommendation engine. Here’s a quick overview:
🔍 What It Does:
This web app allows users to speak a product description (e.g., “a heavy-duty extension cord”) and receive the top 5 similar products from a large Amazon dataset. I used a 1 million-row Excel file from Kaggle containing Amazon product data to power the recommendations.
🧠 How It Works:
•	Voice Input: Users describe a product by speaking.
•	TF-IDF Vectorization: Converts product descriptions into vectors for search.
•	FAISS Search: Uses FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) for fast and efficient similarity matching.
•	Streamlit: A clean, interactive web app for displaying recommendations.
This project showcases the power of NLP and vector search engines to improve e-commerce experiences, making product discovery faster and more intuitive through voice!
🛠️ Technologies Used:
•	Python
•	FAISS for similarity search
•	scikit-learn for TF-IDF vectorization
•	SpeechRecognition for voice input
•	Streamlit for the user interface
📂 Dataset:
The data comes from Kaggle’s Amazon Product Dataset with over 2 million product listings, which allows for a robust and diverse set of product recommendations.
